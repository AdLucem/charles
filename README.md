# CHARLES

CHARLES (CHAracter Resolution Label-Entry System) is a web-application for annotating characters in literary texts. Can be used generally for the task of cross-document entity resolution.

## Configuration

[Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/), a light-weight back-end management service, is used to manage and synchronize CHARLES annotation data. The default Firebase app used contains the _Pride and Prejudice_ demo annotations but to change that, simply replace the value of the `fbLink` property of the `config.json` to link to your own Firebase app.
